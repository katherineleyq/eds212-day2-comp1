## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(3.1 * x^4 - 28*x)

# find derivative of fx and storing it in an object
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# calling the object
df_dx

# assigning x to a value of 10
x <-10

eval(df_dx)
```

Try finding the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}

gt = expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

dg_dt <- D(gt, "z")

z <- 3.6

eval(dg_dt)

#### sequence of 1 to 3, with a length of 20

z <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)
eval(dg_dt)

```
